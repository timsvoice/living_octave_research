WordPress 2.8 and up allow for reasonably simple custom taxonomies, this plugin makes it even simpler, removing the need for you to write <em>any</em> code.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add taxonomies just by giving them a name in the backend. It then creates the taxonomy for you, takes care of the URL rewrites, provides a widget you can use to display a "taxonomy cloud" or a list of all the stuff in there, and it allows you to show the taxonomy contents at the end of posts and excerpts as well.

To boot, it comes with a set of template tags for those who don't mind adapting their own theme.
