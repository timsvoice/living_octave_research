	Destination restaurants need to bring something special to the table. In order to convince people to make the journey, the restaurant needs to create an experience worth traveling for, one that cannot be replicated in an urban setting and fully takes advantage of key components such as easy access to the freshest produce, and ample space.

<h3>Blue Hill at Stone Barns</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131204_Blue-Hill-Exterior_620.png" title="Blue Hill at Stone Barns" alt="Blue Hill at Stone Barns" />

<p>
	Blue Hill at Stone Barns forms part of an 80 acre non-profit agricultural center located 20 miles north of Manhattan. In addition to Blue Hill, the center features a working farm, café, conference, and event spaces, and weekly farmers market.
</p>

<p>
	The farm was built in the 1930’s for the Rockefeller family as a dairy farm but was reinvented in 2004 as an agricultural test lab. Much of what Stone Barns does is geared toward educating the next generation of farmers on how to run sustainable and diversified operations.
</p>

<p>
	Dedication to a cause is the attitude that permeates both Blue Hill and Stone Barns. The farm and the restaurant are so tightly integrated that it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins; chefs work the fields and farmers help out in the kitchen. The most obvious result is the intimate knowledge that each member of the team have about the ingredients that go into your meal, right down to which cow produced the cream that constitutes your butter (her name was Molly, by the way). You would be hard pressed to come up with a question your server would be unable to answer.
</p>

<p>
	Blue Hill is the slow-food, locivore movement taken to its logical extreme. There is no pretending that this can be rolled out at scale; there will never be a Stone Barns in every town. But it does permit the imagination to explore what is possible and work from there to a place where we are all at least modestly connected to our food sources.
</p>

<p>
	Blue Hill at Stone Barns is a non-profit, for-profit hybrid. Blue Hill pays Stone Barns rent for its restaurant and cafe and secures over 80% of it's ingredients from the surrounding farm. The revenues enable the experiment to continue its advance towards a sustainable agriculture system as well as finance several educational projects. In an effort to reconnect children with their food, Stone Barns hosts 7,500 school children a year, teaching them about responsible agriculture and sustainable food systems.

<h3>Fish &amp; Game</h3>

</p>

<p>
	"Fish and Game is housed in a 19th century blacksmith shop in the old rural town of hudson, NY, about 2 hours north of Manhattan. The interior keeps the rustic look of the blacksmith shop, with plenty of stone walls and bare wood. Particularly of note are two open hearths in the dining room, where the kitchen roasts meat on a spit. Besides the dining room, there is also a lounge outfitted with wingback chair and leather couches, and a private upstairs dining room.
</p>

<p>
	The focus here is on locally-grown and -foraged ingredients, more vegetables and "less fatty, less heavy" dishes. Among other things, that means they offer a vegetarian tasting menu alongside their regular tasting menu every night, both of which range from six to seven courses for $65 (which Pelaccio says is about half of what a comparable restaurant in the city would charge). There are also some a la carte items at the bar, and all of the menus change regularly to feature whatever ingredients are of the moment. A recent vegetarian menu included dishes like ramp ragout, carrots in a maple sap glaze, and chocolate cremeaux with black walnuts.
</p>

<p>
	There's also a focus on various house-fermented condiments and sauces, from vinegars and fish sauce to kimchi. These have even made their way into the bar program, which includes a variation on the pickleback that chases a shot of bourbon with a shot of house-made Worcestershire sauce."
</p>

<p>
	One note: A reoccurring theme in Fish & Game's reviews is unreliable service. This is of particular concern to restaurants that draw a crowd from cities like New York, where highly polished and professional service is expected. Despite it's somewhat remote location, Fish & Game is in fact competing directly with restaurants in Manhattan and cannot afford not comply with prevailing standards.
