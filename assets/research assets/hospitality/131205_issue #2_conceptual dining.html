	Conceptual Dining

<!--

	Some restauranteurs seek to challenge diners. They make the familiar strange and the strange familiar or introduce brand new concepts. This is perhaps the riskiest of apraoches, but as M Wells and Momofuku show, the rewards can be enormous.

<h3>Momofuku</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_Momofuku_Labeld-Dinner.png" title="Momofuku Dinner" alt="Momofuku Dinner" />	

<p> 	
	Momofuku Ssam Bar is highly accessible. It draws crowds looking for a quick cheap pork bun + cocktail or larger groups for the Bo Ssam feast, all of which can be got for about $25/person, drinks and other dishes excluded. Yet, despite the casual atmosphere, <a href="http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/david-chang-the-anxiety-of-influence/#1" target="_blank">Davig Chang</a> (one of the more famed New York restaurant royals) makes no bones about experimentation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
	Mr. Chang trusts diners not to be disoriented by an assortment of dishes without any instantly clear theme or overriding ethnic allegiance — by platters of artisanal American hams next to a tangle of Sichuan-style beef tendon alongside a hanger steak with a romesco sauce. He pulls off this eclecticism, which could easily lapse into incoherence, by keeping the menu sufficiently succinct and making sure everything on it counts.

<p>
	Chang manages a portfolio of restaurants that are the perfect high-low mix. He brought downtown to uptown with Ma Peche, and uptown dining downtown with Momofuku Ko, a twelve seater bar that has been likened more to a private dining club than a restaurant. His ubiquitous Milk Bar serves ice-cream sandwiches and coffee, with Momofuku Ssam Bar occupying the middle ground.

<h3>Rouge Tomate and S.P.E.</h3>  

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_Rouge-Tomate_Plate.png" title="Rouge Tomate Plate" alt="Rouge Tomate PLate" />
 
<p>
	Rouge Tomate is trying to kick-start SPE (Sanitas Per Escam, Latin for “health through food”) by acting as an ambassador for the fledgling third-party certification program. The program is designed to be "the universal, trusted standard for healthy and delicious dining outside the home."  
</p>

<p>
	SPE was founded by Emmanuel Verstraeten, founder of Rouge Tomate in Brussels and Manhattan, and adheres to specific guidelines developed by a team of nutritionists. The curly red logo is supposed to signify that the food conforms to three main standards:
</p>
<br class="clear"/>
<ol>
	<li>It is balanced (excludes bad fats, butters and generally contains more of what you need, and less of what you don't)</li>
	<li>It is environmentally sensitive (for example the animal is not on the endangered list)</li>
	<li>It is tasty</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Emmanuel Verstraeten's vision is to have all manner of establishments sign on, from restaurants to college cafeterias to fast food establishments. They have had some success gaining large institutional support having signed on UC Davis and UMass Amherst to the program.  
</p>

<p>
	The SPE standards are proprietary and so when a restaurant signs on, they will have an SPE team evaluate their menu for nutritional value according to their standards. The SPE team will then work with the chef to implement certain changes to the menu item and evaluate proposed additions. The restaurant may then display the SPE logo next to the menu item. 
</p>


<p>SPE certification level:</p>
<br class="clear"/>
<ul>
	<li>Certified (3/10%)</li>
	<li>Silver (25%) </li>
	<li>Gold (50%)</li>
	<li>Platinum (75%)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Which level an establishment achieves, is based on the percentage of SPE certified dishes available on the menu.
</p>

<p>
	Once certified, the restaurant will appear on the SPE website, along wit a nutritional breakdown of the certified meals they offer.

<h3>M. Wells</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_MoMA-PS1_Class-in-Session.png" title="M Wells Dining Room" alt="M Wells Dining Room" />

<p>M Wells is housed in [MOMA PS1](http://www.momaps1.com). The dining room is set up cafeteria style, keeping with the aesthetic of the building, which was a functioning school until 1963. Menus are written on chalk boards and diners are sat at school desks, seated in school chairs, facing the kitchen. The setup suggests that you are there to recieve an education from the chef, and the changing menu written on a chalk board, serves to reinforce the theme.</p> 

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_M-Wells_Chalkboard.png" title="M Wells Chalkboard" alt="M Wells Chalkboard" />

<p>
	The dishes are bold and whimsical and almost always unexpected, revolving generally around the theme of nose-to-tail dining. M Wells is unabashedly decadent, serving rich comfort food (rabbit and foie gras terrine, foie gras oatmeal, veal brain and sweet-breads). 
</p>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_M-Wells_Burger.png" title="M Wells Burger" alt="M Wells Burger" />

<p>
	M Wells treats cuisine as high art, and is perfectly matched to it's museum host. Plates are best enjoyed shared, creating a communal learning experience.
</p>  

<p>
	M Wells expands this year with a full service steakhouse.
