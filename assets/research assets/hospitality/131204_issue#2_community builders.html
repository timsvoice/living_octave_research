	Community Builders

<!--

	All restaurants rely on some form of community to survive. But some take on a central role, becoming a lynchpin for community building. They generate community buy-in, propagate a lifestyle through classes, events and publications, and generally make community engagement central to their success.

<h3>Roberta's</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131204_Robertas_Fun_620.png" title="Roberta's Fun" alt="Roberta's Fun" />

<p>
	Roberta's is located in the post industrial neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn. Housed in an old cinderblock garage, Roberta's has become a culinary destination, drawing diners from all over the city to an area that few had considered venturing to before.
</p> 

<p>
	With no money (except the $5k for the imported pizza oven) Roberta's had to rely on the local artists, the unemployed, students, and friends to gut the warehouse, cart out rubble, move in furniture, and build a base for it's unlikely ascension to “one of the more extraordinary restaurants in the United States.” 
</p>  

<p>
	Roberta's has achieved the rare feat of being at once a destination for enthusiastic foodies and an extremely popular local haunt. The prices are accessible, the beer cheap, and there is ample space to hang out at the bar or grab a table in the garden and enjoy some appetizers.
</p> 

<p>
	The guiding principal behind Roberta's food is the premium placed on sourcing high quality ingredients, “Put the effort into getting the best possible stuff you can get to cook with, and put less effort into cooking.” Unlike may of it's uber-hip contemporaries, who's servers strive for detached indifference, Roberta's service is warm, welcoming and highly professional adding to the harmony between the rough exterior and simple food. The wood stove out back that heats the tiki bar, the rooftop farm, the radio station all work together to create sense of community.
</p>

<p>
	In the last few years, Roberta's founders have worked to expand their influence beyond their cinderblock walls: Roberta's now boasts a radio station (they are both former musicians), has invested in the first and largest rooftop farm organization in New York, and advocate for local, sustainable, affordable food in partnership with the non-profit, <a href="http://www.grownyc.org" target="_blank">GrowNYC</a>
</p>

<p>
	As the cheap rent permitted plenty experimentation for Roberta's, it's success has afforded it another opportunity. In 2010 Roberta's sister restaurant Blanca, a twelve seater chef's tasting counter next door to the original location, opened. In contrast with the rough aesthetic next door, the sleek stone counter, finished walls, and leather seats invite you to truly treat it as an adventure in culinary experimentation.

<h3>ISA</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131204_ISA_Theater_620.png" title="ISA Dinner Theater" alt="ISA Dinner Theater" />
  

<p>
	In it's three year history ISA has transformed from experimental and unusual to more casual, easy fare. When it first opened in 2011, ISA was greeted by the critics with equal acclaim and confusion. Deep fried sardine skeletons and spelt soup drew praise, while hay dusted root vegetables drew skepticism. ISA soon gained a cult following among the city's foodies, but it appeared this was far from Somer's original intention. He soon dismissed the entire kitchen crew, installing husband and wife team Preston and Ginger Madson. The new team ditched the test lab approach for comfortable, rustic and familiar dishes like wood fire roasted chicken and fresh baked bread. Shared plates dominate (appetizers outnumber entrees 10 to 2) and the best seat in the house is a long communal table positioned in front of the open kitchen.
</p>

<p>
	“Isa was always meant to be a cozy, neighborhood dining destination,” said Preston. “With the new menu, I'm trying to have something for everyone so no one feels excluded.”
</p>

<p>
	Taavo hopes to appeal to a more local, easy-going crowd that wants a simple, well made meal in a cozy environment. He achieves this not only through his menu and cocktail program but by maintaining a strong digital presence and hosting classes and other community building events.
</p>

<p>
	ISA has partnered with several groups like Friends &amp; Family, and brunchCRAFT to bring a variety of classes and activities to the 2nd floor. This past year ISA has hosted variety shows, collage workshops and Mindfulness Meals, a free mindfulness class followed by a communal meal served downstairs. ISA also launched their monthly newsletter 'ISA Pages' this year, informing local residents of events and featuring interviews with local artisits.
</p>

<p>
	'Modern Primitive' has been used to describe ISA with it's hand crafted wooden interiors and open kitchen, complete with wood fired oven. Taavo designed and built most of the restaurant himself. Along with a team of carpenters, he inhabited the space nearly everyday for 9 months, molding the design to the space.

<p>
	The atmosphere is cozy, homey, and comfortable. Triangles appear everywhere and in place in art, ISA displays ceramics and macrame.
</p>

<p>
	In 2013 won the James Beard award for best U.S. restaurant design or renovation.
