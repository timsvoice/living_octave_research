	Retail-Restaurant, Restaurant-Retail		

<!--

place article summary here

	Restaurants with strong retail components are able to capture otherwise untapped revenues as well as reenforce their brand. The strongest players in this category achieve an almost seamless unity of product and plate and invite guests to more fully embrace their culinary philosophies. Miss Lily's and Eataly have almost equal parts market and restaurant, while Il Laboritorio's store front is just the tip of the gelato iceburg.

 <h3>Eataly</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/20120703_birdsEye_eataly.png" title="Eataly Market" alt="Eataly Market" />

 <p>
 	Eataly is a market f&amp;b concept on a grand scale. Mario Betali, Joe Bastianich, and Lidia Bastianich have created a fantasy land of Italian food, produce, and education. <i>"we cook what we sell, and we sell what we cook"</i> is the philosophy and it applies to everything from the meat to the bread to the cookbooks and equipment. The trio's decades of experience are embedded in the layout, showing a keen awareness of diner's interests, shopper's habits and retail best practices. The meanering halls seem random, but a closer look reveals a clearly organized path that presents the guest with various moments to explore. The apparent absence of checkout points (until of course you reach them at just the right time) engenders the feeling that you are truly in a market, populated by individual salesmen all cooperating in an invisible hand kind of way to deliver a holistic culinary/retail experience. 
</p>

<p>	
	The Eataly trio are, in a sense, making a fortune by giving away their secrets: they invite people into the kitchen with cooking classes, they sell both the recipes and raw materials from which their dishes are made with the market and library, and offer expertise to shoppers at the various sales points. Their true success however is about their larger than life personalities, sophisticated sensibilities, and decades of experience; things that cannot be replicated.

<h3>Il Laboratorio del Gelato</h3>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_Il-Laboratorio-del-Gelato_Counter.png" title="Il Laboritorio Counter" alt="Il Laboritorio Counter" />

<p>
	Jon Snyder began working in his family owned Carvel Ice Cream franchise at an early age, but always had a taste for the experimental. His exploration lead to two enterprises: Ciao Bella which he later sold to attend Columbia business school and his current project, Il Laboratorio del Gelato. 
</p>

<img src="assets/research assets/hospitality/images/131105_Il-Laboratorio-del-Gelato_Machines.png" title="Il Laboritorio Machines" alt="Il Laboritorio Machines" />

<p>
	At Il Laboratorio fresh ingredients are prepared by hand and crafted into unusual flavors; avocado, black peppercorn, rosemary, olive oil, and Guinness to name a few. Jon works closely with local restaurants to create custom gelatos for their menus and has produced over 200 new flavors with his chef collaborators. 
</p>

<i>
	“Chefs can come, consult and experiment to create innovative flavors for their restaurants.”
</i>

<p>
	Although the Lab’s two machines churn out gelato non-stop for 10 hours a day, Jon has turned down many requests for expansion, saying “With food bigger is not better, smaller is better”. 
</p>

<i>
	“We want to be the best gelato address in New York City and that means we have to stay small and exclusive. And we aim to continue working hand in glove with the foremost chefs. That is and will remain our core business”.
</i> 

<p>
	90% of Il Laboratorio’s business comes from wholesale customers. Only a small portion of The Lab’s gelato is sold retail but by opening up to the public Jon has kept the critics interested and Il Laboratorio’s name in the press.
</p>

<p>
	Il Laboratorio has not just been a success for its founder but also for the then up and coming neighborhood it occupies. <i>“We were really the first to be there. There was nothing south of Delancey Street then but fabric shops.”</i> 
</p>

<p>
	Its stores like Jon’s that draw a crowd seeking artisanal products and unique experiences that are helping to transform Manhattan’s Lower Eastside from a predominantly lower-class working neighborhood into one of the trendiest locations in the city. Since Il Laboratorio moved to the area in 2002, median rent prices have increased from $738 to $1375 beating the New York City average increase by 28%.
